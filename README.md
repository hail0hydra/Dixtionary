- This is a simple __terminal based dictionary__ written to help you understand things when you read your pdfs and books from terminal. ðŸ“š

- Uses `mpv` and an opensource `api` which you can find in the code. Json parsing is done using `jq` :).



## Installation âš’

<br>

- Git clone

```bash
git clone https://hail0hydra/ShellSpeak
```

- Go into the directory

```bash
cd ShellSpeak
```

- Simple run the program :)

```bash
./meaning.sh 
```

- Added support for windows as well. Just make sure you have `jq` avialable in path.

```powershell
scoop install jq
```

- use [this](./meaning.ps1) script instead of the bash one.

- make sure to add it in the `env`.

```powershell
meaning.ps1
```
